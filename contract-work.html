				<div class="card-body bg-dark">
					<h5 class="card-title text-center text-white" id="HeadingThree">Design of a Website</h5>
					<p class="card-text text-white" id="text2">Web design is the first stage of turning the idea you have for a website into a reality. During this stage, designers use a method referred to as wireframing. Wireframing, in its simplest terms, is
						a rough draft where you lay out all the ideas you have on paper as well as the message you are trying to communicate to your intended audience. Once that is complete, the Designer uses all this information to create a visually pleasing
						layout for your website and ensure the content is appropriately placed to tell your story.</p>
					<p class="card-text text-white" id="text2">With the Web Design package, you will receive JPEG images for each page of your site. From there, you can work with a programmer such as myself to have the code created. Another option would be to
						use the wireframing as a guide to assist you in building your website on a platform such as WordPress or Wix.</p>
					<p class="card-text text-white" id="text2">The cost for the Web Design service ranges depending on the number of pages and complexity of the site <strong>but starts at <span class="text-success">$4,000.00</span> for up to a 7-page
							website</strong>.</p>

				<div class="card-body bg-dark">
					<h5 class="card-title text-center text-white" id="HeadingThree">Code for a Website</h5>
					<p class="card-text text-white" id="text2">The second phase of the website development process is coding. Coding is the process of turning wireframing into reality. There are two sides to the coding process, Front-End, and Back-End.
						Front-End Developers use HTML, CSS, and Javascript programming languages to code everything a user will see when they visit your site. Back-End Developers use PHP, Ruby, Python, and other programming languages to create the server-side of
						your website. The server-side covers everything not seen by users who visit your site, but that makes your website function.</p>
					<p class="card-text text-white" id="text2">As a professional Front-End Developer, I can create all the code necessary for the Front-End of your website. With this package, you will receive all the required Front-End code (HTML, CSS, and
						Javascript) for your site. This option is excellent for people who want a professional website build, and want to work with a Back-End Developer or another company for the server-side of your site.</p>
					<p class="card-text text-white" id="text2">The cost for the service ranges depending on the number of pages and complexity of the site <strong>but starts at <span class="text-success">$4,400.00</span> for up to a 7-page website</strong>.

					<h5 class="card-title text-center text-white" id="HeadingThree">Building a Website</h5>
					<p class="card-text text-center text-white" id="text2">Taking your idea and desire for a website and turning it into reality is the main service I offer as a freelance Front-End Developer. With this option, I will work with you to design
						and create a wireframe for your website, and once we have a design, you love. I will turn that wireframe into a live working website. With this option, I will create all the Front-End Code to make your site work. Then using a platform
						such as HostGator, I will upload the code to a hosting server. From there, within 24 hours, your website will be live online and ready for use.</p>
					<p class="card-text text-center text-white" id="text2">Please note, with this option in addition to the charges for my service of designing and building the website. There will be the cost of purchasing a domain name, and the cost the
						hosting service will charge due upfront. I will only charge you what the other companies charge for these services and will not add anything on top of their prices.</p>
					<p class="card-text text-center text-white" id="text2"> The cost for my portion building your website will range depending on the number of pages and the complexity of the site <strong>but starts at <span

					<p class="card-text text-center text-white" id="text2">Like the Building a Website option, I also offer those who prefer it a WordPress option. With this option, I will work with you to design and create a wireframe for your website. The
						key difference between this option and the Build a Website option is instead of coding the website myself. I will create your website using WordPress. Similar to the Building a Website package, this option will also require the purchase
						of a domain name and the use of a hosting service. It may take up to 24 hours once completed for your website to go live.</p>

					<p class="card-text text-center text-white" id="text2">As we all know, things are continually changing and improving, and technology and website are no different. It seems like what was cutting edge just last year is no longer in style as
						we continuously strive for newer, bigger, and faster tech. Keeping your website up to date is critical. Not only do you need the most updated information on your website as far as products and services you offer are concerned, but you
						also need an updated design, look, and feel to your site. As a Freelance Front-End Web Developer, one of the services I offer is updating your existing website. With this option, I will examine your existing website and make some
						suggestions and changes. From there, I will create a wireframe showing you what your new website could look like. Finally, I will make the necessary changes to the code to update your website.</p>
